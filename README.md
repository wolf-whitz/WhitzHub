A simple project—a project made with love (kidding, I’m just bored of searching my executors for scripts, lmfao).

This is built with a simple bundler system. Check out bundler.js and extract it along with its dependencies if you want to use it for your project or whatever.

To use this, run:

```loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wolf-whitz/WhitzHub/main/dist/bundle.lua"))()```


To add your own scripts, navigate to src/scripts:

Add your scripts, or create a folder for your scripts.

Modify index.js with 4 keys: name, section, url, and description.

url defines the location of your script, e.g.:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wolf-whitz/WhitzHub/main/src/scripts/luas/universal/iy.lua

Note: You cannot use other CDNs—only URLs matching raw.githubusercontent.com/.*.

section defines what section you want your script to reside in
